# simple_trivia_game

This is simple_trivia_game, which is a C#/.NET Core console application that utilizes the Open Trivia Database API (https://opentdb.com/).

I got bored one afternoon -- so I conceived the idea of creating a simple trivia game that can keep my mind sharp in more ways than one.

If you want to play the pre-built game for yourself, check Releases on the GitHub page. And if you want to mess with the source, there it is. Any contributions are welcome and appreciated.

As far as libraries, Newtonsoft.Json is all that is required should that not be in there already. That can be obtained the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.

## Known issues (1.0.0)
Just an issue that I ran into developing this game:
* Some characters such as quotes and ampersands will not show properly

## Parting words
This project is another one for my GitHub portfolio, but I hope someone finds this useful if they want a neat C# incorporation of the Open Trivia Database API, it's a nice service that is free and pushes out those mentally stimulating trivia questions.
